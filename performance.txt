Measuring the time and performance for the tasks executed in Hadoop and Spark. 
Medium used: Hortonworks Sandbox and Virtual Box

Time measured with the date command while executing the tasks. 
Programming Language: Java

Observations:

Hadoop Task 1: 2 min 35 sec
Hadoop Task 2: 1 min 11 sec
Hadoop Task 3: 1 min 10 sec

Spark Task 1: 29sec
Spark Task 2: 6.40 sec


The time taken in Apache Spark is much lesser than that compared to Hadoop.
